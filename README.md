**Summary**

PictureHub is a straightforward image sharing application designed to consolidate the contributions of users with similiar interests
into easily accessible categories.

From the front page, any visitor may enter a public category gallery, such as "Funny" or "Art." Clicking on any picture in the gallery 
will bring up the image viewer, enlarging the selected image, and displaying a caption, if one was provided. While the viewer is open, 
a user is able to advance forwards or backwards through the category. Users can also comment on individual pictures. If a user wishes 
to upload their own pictures, they must register an account with the application. Users can upload pictures of any image format, choose 
categor(ies) to add the picture to, and attach a caption. Registered users can "track" their favourite categories, which will update the 
user's home page with the most recent uploads in those categories. Similarily, users can also track other users, seeing their most recent uploads.
