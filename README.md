Project Name: PictureHub 
Team Members: Nigel Mason, Bo Liu

Description:

PictureHub is an application that allows registered users to upload pictures
and associate them with a category. Users can browse pictures by category 
(e.g. funny, sports, animals, etc.) as well as add other users as �friends� 
in order to be updated when their friends upload new pictures. When an album 
or category is selected, the �album viewer� will appear, which is an isolated 
window that enlarges the current image, and allows the user to move backward or 
forward through the album/category. Users can comment on an individual picture, 
and attach a timer to their own pictures that can count down to or up from a significant 
event associated with a picture. The duties of the backend store will be to store user 
account information and the pictures themselves. The web server will facilitate user 
authentication and content retrieval, and the client will facilitate navigation through 
the application.
