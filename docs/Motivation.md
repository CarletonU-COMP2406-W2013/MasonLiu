Motivation
==========

The motivation behind PictureHub was to create an uncomplicated application for 
people who spend a lot of time browsing through online galleries of images. If a user
is only interested in seeing funny things (e.g. memes), they should simply be able to
navigate to a page that lets them see images that uploaders have categorized as funny. The
same goes for any other "category" of images, which makes it a great application for users
interested in, for example, a specific kind of photography, or a certain style of art.

The main project goals were to:
- Allow users to register an account, and authenticate the user upon login
- Allow registered users to upload pictures, optionally associating each picture with one 
  or more categor(ies), a caption, and a timer to count down to or up from a significant event
  associated with the picture
- Allow ANY user to view a collection of pictures in an isolated image viewer, with the ability to
  scroll through images in the collection without leaving the viewer window
- Allow registered users to leave comments on an individual picture
- Allow users to keep track of categories that they like, and have the most recent additions to 
  their "tracked categories" appear on their home page
- Allow users to track other users and be updated on their uploads in the same way as the tracked
  categories
